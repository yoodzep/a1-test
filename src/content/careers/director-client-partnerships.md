## About the role

As Director of Client Partnerships, you will lead our most important client and developer relationships. Your focus will be ensuring projects are clearly defined, expectations are aligned early, and delivery teams are set up to succeed from pre-construction through handover.

This role sits at the intersection of client relations and project execution, requiring a strong understanding of both commercial considerations and on-the-ground realities.

## What you’ll do

You’ll work closely with clients during early discussions to define scope, timelines, and priorities. Throughout delivery, you’ll remain engaged, helping resolve issues, maintain alignment, and ensure communication stays clear and consistent.

You’ll collaborate with project managers, operations leadership, and site teams to ensure commitments made to clients are practical, achievable, and delivered as agreed.

## Who you are

You’re a trusted senior partner who understands how construction projects actually run. You’re comfortable navigating complex stakeholder environments, managing expectations, and making informed decisions when conditions change.

You bring a calm, structured approach to problem-solving and know how to balance relationships with accountability.

## Why join us

You’ll play a key role in shaping long-term client relationships and supporting projects that are built to last. This position offers meaningful influence across both client strategy and project delivery, with the opportunity to contribute at a senior level as the company grows.
