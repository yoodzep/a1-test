## Overview

When working near overhead power lines, safety is critical. A1 Electrical provides power line wrapping and tiger tail installation services to protect workers and equipment from accidental contact with live conductors.

## What Are Power Line Wraps?

Power line wraps (also called line guards or insulating covers) are protective shields installed over overhead power lines to prevent accidental contact during nearby work. While they don't make the lines safe to touch, they provide an additional layer of protection.

## Tiger Tails

Tiger tails are brightly coloured markers attached to power lines to increase visibility. They help machinery operators and workers see the power lines clearly, reducing the risk of accidental contact.

## When You Need This Service

- **Construction sites** - Crane operation, scaffolding, elevated work platforms
- **Tree work** - Trimming, felling, or removal near power lines
- **Building work** - Roofing, painting, or facade work near lines
- **Transport** - Moving oversized loads that may come close to lines

## Our Process

1. **Site assessment** - Evaluate the work area and power line configuration
2. **Coordination** - Work with network companies as required
3. **Installation** - Install wraps and/or tiger tails safely
4. **Documentation** - Provide records of installed protection
5. **Removal** - Remove equipment when work is complete

## Safety First

Working near power lines is inherently dangerous. Power line wraps and tiger tails are supplementary protection measures, not a substitute for proper clearance distances and safe work practices. We can advise on the appropriate safety measures for your situation.

## Quality Assurance

All power line protection work is carried out by qualified electricians following industry safety standards. We coordinate with network operators and provide documentation for your site safety records.
