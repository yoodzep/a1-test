## Overview

MEP systems make or break building performance. We coordinate trades early, resolve conflicts before they hit the field, and oversee installation so commissioning is smooth and predictable.

## What we provide

We run coordination sessions with BIM and shop drawings, sequence work to avoid rework, and manage inspections. Testing, adjusting, and balancing are documented, and handover packages include as-builts, O&M, and training.

## Ideal for

- Projects with dense services or tight ceiling plenum space  
- Builds requiring strict performance and compliance standards  
- Owners who want reliable turnover with minimal post-handover issues  

## Outcomes

Fewer clashes, cleaner installs, and systems that meet spec on day one. Facilities teams get clear documentation, and occupants get consistent performance.
