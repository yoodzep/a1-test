## Working with Older Homes

Dunedin has many character homes that require careful electrical work. We understand the unique challenges of working with older wiring systems and can assess whether upgrades or rewiring is needed.

## Quality Assurance

Every renovation project includes a thorough inspection of existing electrical systems. We'll identify any safety concerns and ensure all new work meets current standards. All work is certified and documented.
