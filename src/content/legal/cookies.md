# Cookie Notice

We use cookies and similar technologies to ensure the site functions correctly, stays secure, and improves over time. This notice explains what we use, why we use it, and the choices you have.

## What are cookies?
Cookies are small text files stored on your device when you visit a website. They help sites remember preferences, maintain sessions, and understand how visitors interact with content.

## Types of cookies we use

**Essential cookies**  
These are required for core functionality such as security, authentication, and basic site operations. Without them, the site will not work properly. Essential cookies are always enabled.

**Analytics cookies (optional)**  
These help us understand how the site is used—what pages are visited, what features perform well, and where improvements are needed. Analytics data is aggregated and not used to personally identify you. You can disable these through your browser settings or opt out when controls are available.

## Your choices and controls
Most browsers allow you to view, block, or delete cookies. You can usually configure these settings to suit your preferences. Be aware that disabling essential cookies may cause parts of the site to break or behave unpredictably.

## Updates to this notice
We may update this Cookie Notice from time to time to reflect changes in technology, legal requirements, or how we use cookies. The published date above indicates the most recent revision.

## Contact
If you have questions or concerns about our use of cookies, contact us at
