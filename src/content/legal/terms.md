# Terms of Service

By accessing or using the service, you agree to these Terms of Service and any related policies we reference. If you do not agree, do not use the service.

## Using the service
You agree to use the service in a lawful, respectful, and secure manner. You must not:
- Violate applicable laws or regulations  
- Interfere with or disrupt the service or other users  
- Attempt to access systems, data, or accounts you are not authorized to use  
- Circumvent or probe security or rate limits  

You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account.

## Accounts and content
You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials. You retain ownership of any content you submit or upload.

By submitting content, you grant us a limited, non-exclusive license to host, process, and display that content solely for the purpose of operating and improving the service.

You may not upload content that is illegal, harmful, infringing, or otherwise violates the rights of others.

## Payments and subscriptions
If the service includes paid features, fees are billed in advance and are non-refundable unless required by law or explicitly stated otherwise. Prices, billing cycles, and features may change, and we will provide notice when material changes affect you.

Failure to pay may result in suspension or termination of access to paid features.

## Changes to the service
We may modify, suspend, or discontinue any part of the service at any time. We will make reasonable efforts to provide advance notice when changes materially impact functionality, but we are not obligated to maintain specific features indefinitely.

## Availability and reliability
We aim to provide a reliable service, but uptime is not guaranteed. The service may be unavailable due to maintenance, updates, or factors outside our control. You are responsible for backing up any data you rely on.

## Termination
We may suspend or terminate access to the service if you violate these terms or misuse the service. You may stop using the service at any time.

## Disclaimers and limitation of liability
The service is provided “as is” and “as available.” To the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied.

We are not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, or for loss of data, profits, or business arising from use of the service.

## Governing law
These terms are governed by the laws of our principal place of business, unless local consumer protection laws require otherwise.
