bio: |
  Clara Navarro leads bids and proposals, translating drawings and scopes into clear, competitive submissions that set projects up to win.

  She partners with estimating, operations, and client teams to surface risks early, lock in inclusions, and ensure budgets and timelines are realistic.

  Clara believes clarity at the proposal stage builds trust, reduces change orders, and keeps delivery teams aligned from day one.
